# Introduction and a personal note:
I consider myself an autodidact in the field of computer science with a strong interest for
Secure computing, program analysis and reverse engineering. I have worked with companies
such as google microsoft etc and well-known contractors such as trend micro's
ZeroDayInitiative as well as private contractors unveiling and exploiting security flaws in
commonly used software. I possess a strong and vast knowledge in software security, that
spans from logical errors to memory corruptions, from web technology to compilers and
operating systems. I am comfortable with C/C++, Assembly (ARM, Intel x86, x64, Aarch64,
desktop|mobile|embedded) and can code in many programming languages. I am comfortable
with tools such as ida for closed source static analysis, or source code review for open-
sources projects. I am experienced and comfortable with various debuggers and platforms.
When needed I would develop my own tools in order to advance my research. During my
work I have developed fuzzing tools and triaged countless memory corruption issues. I have
reversed engineered closed source software from various windows applications to apple’s
boot-loaders. I am adjudicated about software exploitation and have developed several
exploits for 0-day flaws in software. Due to the nature of my work, a big percentage of my
projects are closed sourced and NDA protected. I am well knowledgeable with a vast scope of
different Security bug classes and have bypassed several novel-state of the art mitigation's. In
addition I got knowledge about post exploitation and product design. I am aware of different
web technologies, protocols, and wifi communications. I have experience with software
development as well, from high level web servers to low level Computing (on multiple
different architectures and platforms).
